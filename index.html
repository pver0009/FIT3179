            <p>This interactive dashboard visualizes cost of living indices, income levels, and expenditure patterns across 
                Australian states and territories. Designed for Australians seeking to understand regional affordability, 
                it enables informed decisions about living locations and financial planning through comparative visualizations 
                of household spending and earnings data.</p>

                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Australia's economy experienced its most significant inflation surge in decades, with rates peaking at 7.8% in late 2022. The unprecedented convergence between headline CPI and trimmed mean inflation revealed broad-based price pressures affecting all sectors. While the economy shows gradual recovery toward the RBA's target band, this inflationary period fundamentally reshaped household financial pressures and purchasing power across the nation.</p>

                <div id="cost_of_living_map"></div>
                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Contrary to common perception, Brisbane leads with the highest cost of living index (144.1), surpassing traditional expensive cities like Sydney and Melbourne. Western Australia shows the fastest-growing costs, with Perth experiencing 2.7% annual inflation. The concentration of population in high-cost cities means most Australians face elevated living expenses, challenging assumptions about regional affordability.</p>

                <div id="earnings_by_gender"></div>
                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Significant earning disparities exist across geography and gender, with ACT residents earning 25% more than Tasmanians. The national gender pay gap persists at $242 weekly, most pronounced in Western Australia where males earn $457 more than females. These disparities highlight how location and gender continue to shape financial outcomes, creating vastly different starting points for managing living costs.</p>

            <h2>Weekly Earnings vs Essential Spending by State</h2>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <div id="earnings_spending_comparison"></div>
                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Higher earnings don't guarantee better living standards, as essential costs often scale with income levels. Western Australia and ACT lead in earnings but face proportionally higher living expenses, diminishing their disposable income advantage. Tasmania's low-income households confront different challenges, where modest costs still strain limited budgets. True affordability emerges from the delicate balance between local earnings and regional price structures.</p>

                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Housing dominates Australian budgets, consuming 22.5% of the average $2,010 weekly wage. Combined with food (16.6%) and transport (14.5%), these essentials claim over half of household income, leaving limited discretionary spending. The allocation reveals national priorities and pressures, with recreation maintaining a significant share despite financial constraints, indicating Australians value lifestyle balance amid cost pressures.</p>

                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Four decades of data reveal a fundamental restructuring of Australian household budgets, with housing's share nearly doubling since 1984. This dramatic increase came at the expense of clothing, food, and transport expenditures, while essential services like healthcare and education gained prominence. The transformation illustrates how housing affordability pressures have forced Australians to reallocate spending from discretionary categories to essential services and shelter.</p>

                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Current inflationary pressures show remarkable divergence across spending categories. Alcohol/tobacco (5.7%) and education (5.5%) lead price increases, while transport costs provide rare relief with 2.6% deflation. Health expenses continue to outpace general inflation at 4.1%, maintaining pressure on household budgets. This uneven landscape creates a mixed financial experience where some essentials become more affordable while others escalate rapidly.</p>

                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Employee households experienced the steepest cost increases during recent inflation peaks, reflecting their exposure to rising mortgage and transportation costs. Pensioners showed more moderate increases, benefiting from different consumption patterns and government support mechanisms. Self-funded retirees faced intermediate pressures, caught between essential healthcare costs and reduced discretionary spending. These differential impacts demonstrate how the same economic conditions create varied financial stress depending on household composition.</p>

                <div class="chart-description">
                    <p>Insurance and financial services create universal high pressure across all household types, driven by rising mortgage rates and insurance premiums. Pensioners face exceptional strain from alcohol/tobacco excise taxes, while self-funded retirees bear disproportionate health insurance costs. The concentration of pressure in essential services—housing, health, and financial obligations—reveals where Australian households are most vulnerable to economic shifts and policy changes.</p>
